# Michael and Evan's __*printf*__ Project!

## Welcome to our _printf project!
We are trying to make a simple function to print anything by taking input from a string and display it/them using certain specifiers.

## How To Use _printf!
You can start using our code by using _printf in your function or just a simple main function like so:
```
#include "main.h" /* our .h file contains prototypes to assist our _printf */

int main(void) /* main function that returns 0 on success */
{
    _printf("Hello_World\n"); /* this should print "Hello_World" followed by a new line */
    
    return (0);
}
```

### Compilation:
```
$ gcc *.c -o print
```
### Output:
```
$ ./print
Hello, World
$
```
## Low Level Description
1. Output
2. Input (does it only take certain data types?)
3. Formatting
4. An example of using your code, and the output

    1. Use code blocks (already knew this)

### Return Value(s)
* Tell us what you expect the code to return (assuming it does)!
* Tell us what to expect if theres errors (wrong input, special cases that the code doesn't cover yet)

### Formatting
* Tell us what kind of formatting the code expects (if expected)
* Tell us what happens when not used properly!
    
    * Or if there are any bugs (if known)
